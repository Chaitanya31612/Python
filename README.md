 # Python for Data Science and Machine Learning 

> Objective : 

The main objective of these contents is to make students learn the basic working of Python Language along with its usage in Data Sciences. Students will have hands-on with various packages available in Python used for Machine Learning like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Tkinter, etc.  

> Outcome : 

The reader's will learn to analyse the huge data collected on Cloud/Internet using various package available in python. Further the model building using various machine learning algorithms, will enhance the knowledge of budding Data Scientists.   

> Class Example : 

The examples undertaken/coded while demos in class are [available here](./ClassExamples/).
