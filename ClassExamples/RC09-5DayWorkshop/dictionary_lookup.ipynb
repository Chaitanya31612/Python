    "Scope of Variables in Python Tutorial\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn about Python's scope of variables, the global and nonlocal keywords, closures and the LEGB rule.\n",
    "If you're familiar with Python, or any other programming language, you'll certainly know that variables need to be defined before they can be used in your program. Depending on how and where it was defined, a variable will have to be accessed in different ways. Some variables are defined globally, others locally. This means that a variable referring to an entity in a certain part of a program, may refer to something different in another part of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "The true nature of variables\n",
    "The difference between defining a variable inside or outside a Python function\n",
    "global keyword\n",
    "nonlocal keyword\n",
    "Closures in Python\n",
    "LEGB rule\n",
    "If you want to learn more about programming in Python, you should definitely take a look at our free Intro to Python for Data Science course. It covers all the basics, from variables and calculations, to lists, functions and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What are variables, really?\n",
    "To understand the scope of variables, it is important to first learn about what variables really are. Essentially, they're references, or pointers, to an object in memory. When you assign a variable with = to an instance, you're binding (or mapping) the variable to that instance. Multiple variables can be bound to the same instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keeps track of all these mappings with namespaces. These are containers for mapping names of variables to objects. You can think of them as dictionaries, containing name:object mappings. This allows access to objects by names you choose to assign to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, i is first bound to the integer 5. In this case, i is the variable name, while the integer value 5 is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, j is set equal to i. This actually means that j is now bound to the same integer value as i, which is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you then change i to be equal to 3, an inexperienced programmer might expect j to now also be equal to 3, but that is not the case. j is still bound (or pointing) to the integer value of 5. The only thing that changed is i, which is now bound to the integer value 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 5\n",
    "j = i\n",
    "i = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"i: \" + str(i))\n",
    "print(\"j: \" + str(j))\n",
    "i: 3\n",
    "j: 5\n",
    "A namespace for the code above could look like {i:3, j:5}, and not {i:3, j:i} like you might expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between defining a variable inside or outside a Python function\n",
    "If you define a variable at the top of your script, it will be a global variable. This means that it is accessible from anywhere in your script, including from within a function. Take a look at the following example where a is defined globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "function()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "5\n",
    "5\n",
    "In the next example, a is defined globally as 5, but it's defined again as 3, within a function. If you print the value of a from within the function, the value that was defined locally will be printed. If you print a outside of the function, its globally defined value will be printed. The a defined in function() is literally sealed off from the outside world. It can only be accessed locally, from within the same function. So the two a's are different, depending on where you access them from.\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "    a = 3\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "function()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "This is all good and well, but what are the implications of this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, let's say you have an application that remembers a name, which can also be changed with a change_name() function. The name variable is defined globally, and locally within the function. As you can see, the function fails to change the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "name = 'Théo'\n",
    "\n",
    "def change_name(new_name):\n",
    "    name = new_name\n",

    "Luckily, the global keyword can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The global keyword\n",
    "With global, you're telling Python to use the globally defined variable instead of locally defining it. To use it, simply type global, followed by the variable name. In this case, the global variable name can now be changed by change_name().\n",
